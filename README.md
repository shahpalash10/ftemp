# Facial Recognition using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

This project implements a facial recognition model using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The model is capable of generating realistic facial images and recognizing faces from input images.

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of deep learning model consisting of two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, which are trained together in a competitive manner. In this project, we utilize a GAN architecture to generate facial images and then recognize faces from input images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahpalash10/facial-recognition-gan.git
cd facial-recognition-gan
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the following command to train the GAN model:

```bash
python train.py
```

2. After training, you can use the trained model for facial recognition:

```bash
python recognize_faces.py --input <path_to_input_image>
```

Replace `<path_to_input_image>` with the path to the input image you want to perform facial recognition on.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the GAN model consists of facial images. You can use any facial image dataset of your choice, or even a custom dataset.

## Model Architecture

The GAN model architecture consists of a generator and a discriminator network. The generator generates realistic facial images from random noise, while the discriminator distinguishes between real facial images and fake (generated) facial images.

## Results

The trained GAN model can generate realistic facial images and perform facial recognition accurately on input images.
